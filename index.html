    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p>
        I like playing guitar, I like playing video games, and I like hanging out with my friends.

        Recently, I learned how to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdJLXDT_QM">Summertime by George Gershwin</a> on guitar. It was a bit of a challenge but it's helped me grow as a guitar player and musician in general.
